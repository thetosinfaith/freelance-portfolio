              I’m currently a Frontend Web Developer, based in Lagos, Nigeria. I use React to create beautiful, functional websites. Right now, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_OZNg2Ae8xLvymKcp5qaXHZE-obTlYNlNAxQ_nS5UI/view?tab=t.0">I’m looking for a job</a> where I can put my skills to good use and work on meaningful projects.
            </p>
            <h2>Student</h2>
            <p>
              Alongside my career in tech, I’m pursuing a degree in Accounting at the University of Lagos, Nigeria. I also recently graduated from <a href="https://the-curve.africa/">The Curve by Kora</a> as a Frontend Developer, where I had the privilege of mentoring a mentee after graduating.
            </p>
            <h2>Team Lead</h2>
            <p>
              In September 2024, I led a team of 5 to victory at The Curve by Kora Hackathon. Out of 12 teams, we came in first place for our standout work on UI, functionality, and presentation with <a href="https://kindraise.vercel.app/">KindRaise</a>.
